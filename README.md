LESS code for custom styling on Squarespace website.

## Coding Process

I host my website on Squarespace and write my own CSS code to customize and style my Squarespace website to fit my design.

Squarespace allows you to use LESS for more advanded customization and writing of CSS. 

I work on a Mac and prefer to write code in [Nova](https://nova.app/). I use [CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com/) to compile my LESS files into a single LESS file for copying and pasting into my Squarespace site.
